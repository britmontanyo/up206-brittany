## About Me:
Hello! My name is Brittany Montaño and I am first year MURP student at UCLA with a concentration in TPP and hope to pursue classes in economic development. I am born and raised in Long Beach, Ca; always happy be by the coast. I recently graduated from UCLA undergrad with a Bachelors in History and Labor Studies. I have had the opportunity in past to work with L,A.A.N.E., AARP, and LA's Mayor's of Economic Development. Although I've been a California native my entire life, I am trying to explore my state and its various communities. I am currently a GSR at the UCLA Labor Center specifically on their workers and learners projects and hope to apply a labor lens to my future work.
## Description of the Course:
By learning spatial data science, we will begin to understand as urban planners how to apply data science (python) tools in any desired concentration. Not only will we be able to analyze and work on data, we will then be able to create visual aide that become digestable and accesible to communities that are affected. 
## Project Ideas:
1. A comparison of the economic development/impact of the Port Long Beach and Port of Los Angeles and its direct environmental effect on the South Bay community (Torrance, Carson, Wilmington, and Harbor City) by using the Calenviroscreen
2. An analysis of air pollution from Truck Drivers and Trains from the Port and the affect it has on South Bay children's health (how many students are affected).
3. A comparison of the private and public interests' economic investments into big businesses in the South Bay area while mapping the amount of local businesses' stability during the pandemic. 
## Objectives for the Course:
1. To establish a thorough understanding of Python and be able to independently code
2. Understand how to navigate data science tools and create maps or visiual aides of data
